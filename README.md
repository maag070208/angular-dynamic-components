# Angular Dynamic Table component with dynamic components inside the table

## what problems does this solution solve?

Well, let's see it from a point of view in which we have an atomic table component, in which we want to pass only the information that our table will carry and the columns that it must show, and also that there are dynamic components within the table, as in this example a component that depending on the status will paint a chip in a different color with a different icon.

### So, happy code!
